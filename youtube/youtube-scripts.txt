Got it 🚀 — let’s make a 3-minute viral YouTube demo plan for your Monexa project.
The key is to tell a story + show value in action + finish with a vision.
Here’s a complete package for slides, talking script, and flow:

🎬 YouTube Demo (3 minutes)
🔹 Total Time: ~3:00 minutes

0:00 – 0:30 → Hook (Problem)

0:30 – 1:30 → Demo (Solution in Action)

1:30 – 2:30 → Features & Wow Moments

2:30 – 3:00 → Roadmap & Call to Action

🖼️ Slide 1: “Where did my money go?”

Visual: Messy bills, SMS alerts, bank statements, UPI messages flying on screen.

Script:

"We all spend money every day — groceries, GPay, Amazon, banks, Paytm. But at the end of the month, most of us ask one question: Where did all my money go?"

🖼️ Slide 2: Monexa – The Personal Expense Assistant

Visual: Logo + tagline (“Know your money, own your future”).

Script:
"Introducing Monexa — your AI-powered expense manager that works with any source: banks, wallets, shopping, even handwritten bills. In seconds, Monexa turns raw transactions into clear insights and answers."

🖼️ Slide 3: Live Demo – Upload a Bill / CSV

Visual: Screen recording of uploading CSV / receipt → dashboard refresh.

Script:

"Just upload your bill or bank CSV. Monexa parses it automatically — header totals in one table, item details in another. No manual entry. Done!"

🖼️ Slide 4: Dashboard

Visual: Totals, daily trend chart, category breakdown (show gpay, groceries, misc).

Script:

"Instantly, your dashboard updates — total spend, daily trend, categories, top merchants. Refunds are shown separately so you don’t get confused."

🖼️ Slide 5: Chat with Your Expenses

Visual: Screen recording — user types “How much I spent on coffee this month?” → AI answers.

Script:

"And here’s the magic — you can chat with your expenses. Ask anything: ‘How much on wheat this month?’, ‘Top 5 merchants?’, ‘Large transactions above ₹1000?’. Monexa pulls real answers from your data — no guesswork, no synthetic data."

🖼️ Slide 6: AI + Future Roadmap

Visual: Future: voice assistant, IoT sensors, live integration with banks, cross-country support.

Script:

"This is just the beginning. Next, Monexa will integrate IoT, smart receipts, and cross-country banks. Imagine asking your voice assistant: ‘How much can I save this week?’ and getting an instant financial health check."

🖼️ Slide 7: Closing – Call to Action

Visual: “Monexa – Track. Understand. Win.” + applause emoji.

Script:

"Monexa isn’t just an app — it’s your financial twin, built to help every person in the world take control of their money. This is the future of personal finance. Let’s build it together."

🗣️ Tone & Style

Fast, energetic voice — like Apple keynotes but personal.

Use zoom-in effects on charts/chat demo.

Keep text minimal on slides — visuals do the talking.

End with roadmap + vision → prize-winning feel.

⚡ Bonus: In the video description, link GitHub + live demo URL + tagline.


🎤 Teleprompter Script (3 minutes)
[0:00 – 0:30 → Hook]

(Show messy bills, SMS, bank alerts flying across the screen)

"Every month we all ask the same question: Where did my money go?
Bills, SMS alerts, GPay, Paytm, Amazon, banks — data everywhere, insights nowhere.
Managing expenses is painful. But what if you could get instant clarity, like chatting with a friend?"

[0:30 – 1:00 → Introduction to Monexa]

(Show Monexa logo + tagline: Know your money, own your future)

"Meet Monexa, your AI-powered expense assistant.
Upload any source — banks from India, USA, Canada, digital wallets like Paytm, PhonePe, GPay, even handwritten bills.
Monexa automatically parses, cleans, and structures your data — header totals go to the expense table, line items go to the detail table — all in seconds."

[1:00 – 1:30 → Demo: Upload + Dashboard]

(Screen capture: uploading CSV, dashboard refreshing with totals & charts)

"Watch this: I just upload a CSV.
Instantly, Monexa updates the dashboard.
You see your total spend, daily trend, category summary, top merchants, and refunds tracked separately.
No spreadsheets, no manual entry — just clarity."

[1:30 – 2:00 → Demo: Chat Assistant]

(Screen capture: Chat UI — user types ‘How much I spent on coffee this month?’ → AI reply)

"But here’s the magic. You can chat with your expenses.
Ask: ‘How much I spent on coffee this month?’ → Monexa checks your real transactions and gives the answer.

‘Show me large transactions above ₹1000’ → Done.
It’s like ChatGPT, but connected to your wallet."

Soon, Monexa will integrate IoT sensors, voice assistants, and real-time bank APIs worldwide.

It’s your financial twin, always working for you."

[2:30 – 3:00 → Closing Call to Action]

It’s built for every person in the world, to bring financial clarity and control.
