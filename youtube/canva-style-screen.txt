Hereâ€™s your next step to get a real Canva template link:

Go to Canva Presentations
.

Create a blank 16:9 presentation.

Add the slides exactly as per the Slide-by-Slide Template Layout I gave you.

Upload your Monexa screenshots (dashboard, reports, chat).

Apply the colors + fonts listed.

Once finished â†’ Click Share â†’ Template link â†’ Copy link.

This gives you a link that others can open and use as their own template.

ðŸ‘‰ If you want, I can prepare the speaker script timing (3 minutes) aligned with these 8 slides so you can practice like a TED-style pitch.

Do you want me to prepare that polished script now (slide by slide with timestamps)?
